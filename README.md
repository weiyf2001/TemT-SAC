## üå§Ô∏è TemT-SAC

### Description
TemT-SAC (Temporal-Spatial Attention Convolutional Network) is a state-of-the-art model designed for high-resolution, accurate short-term and medium-range weather forecasting. Built upon modern convolutional architectures and attention mechanisms, it captures complex spatiotemporal dependencies across multiple atmospheric variables.

## üåç Pangu-Weather

### Description
[Pangu-Weather](https://github.com/198808xc/Pangu-Weather ) is a 3D high-resolution neural network model developed by Huawei Cloud for fast and accurate global weather forecasting. It achieves superior performance in predicting various meteorological variables over medium-range timeframes.

The model has been integrated into the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational suite and is publicly accessible for 10-day global forecasts.

## üìä ERA5 Dataset

### Description
The **ERA5 dataset** from the Copernicus Climate Change Service provides global historical weather data at high spatial and temporal resolution. It includes surface and upper-air meteorological variables, serving as the backbone for training and validating AI-based forecasting models like Pangu-Weather and TemT-SAC.
